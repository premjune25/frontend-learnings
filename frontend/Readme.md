# Prem Singh's Developer Journey

Welcome to my personal project repository! I am Prem Singh, an aspiring web developer currently learning a variety of technologies to build modern web applications. Below are the key areas I am focusing on, along with brief descriptions of each.

## Topics I'm Learning:

### 1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the foundation of web development, used to structure the content on the web. I am learning how to create semantic and accessible layouts for web pages.

### 2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is used to style HTML elements. I am exploring ways to enhance the visual appearance of websites by applying styles, using techniques like Flexbox and Grid.

### 3. JavaScript (JS)
JavaScript is a programming language that enables interactive web features. I am mastering core concepts like variables, loops, functions, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

### 4. Tailwind CSS
Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that helps build custom designs rapidly. I am learning how to efficiently style web components by using predefined classes.

### 5. React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. I am focused on developing component-based architectures and managing application state in dynamic single-page applications (SPAs).

### 6. Redux
Redux is a state management tool often used with React. I am learning how to manage and share state across components, improving application performance and predictability.

### 7. Data Structures
Understanding data structures like arrays, stacks, queues, and linked lists is critical for writing efficient algorithms. I am learning how to implement and utilize these structures to optimize my code.

### 8. Python
Python is a versatile programming language, and I am exploring its basics. I am learning about syntax, data types, control structures, and functions to build basic scripts and algorithms.

### 9. MySQL Database
MySQL is a relational database management system. I am learning how to design and manage databases using SQL queries for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and complex queries like JOINs and transactions.

### 10. Git Commands
Git is a version control system. I am learning essential commands to collaborate effectively on projects.

#### Git Example Workflow:
1. **Initialize a Repository**  
   Initialize a new Git repository in your project folder:  
   ```bash
   git init

2. Check Status
View the status of your repository (to see untracked files):

git status

3. Add Files to Staging
Add specific files or all files to the staging area:

git add <file-name>    # Adds specific file
git add .              # Adds all files in the current directory

4. Commit Changes
Commit your staged changes with a message:

git commit -m "Your commit message"

5. Push Changes to Remote Repository
Push your local commits to the remote repository (e.g., GitHub):

git push origin main

enter user name and password here

6. Create a New Branch
Create and switch to a new branch for feature development:

git branch <branch-name>    # Create new branch
git checkout <branch-name>  # Switch to new branch


7. Pull Updates from Remote
Fetch and integrate changes from the remote repository:
git pull origin main
