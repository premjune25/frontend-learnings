# Prem Singh's Developer Journey

Welcome to my personal project repository! I am **Prem Singh**, an aspiring web developer currently learning a variety of technologies to build modern web applications. Below are the key areas I am focusing on, along with brief descriptions of each.

## Topics I'm Learning:

### 1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the foundation of web development, used to structure the content on the web. I am learning how to create semantic and accessible layouts for web pages.

### 2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is used to style HTML elements. I am exploring ways to enhance the visual appearance of websites by applying styles, using techniques like Flexbox and Grid.

### 3. JavaScript (JS)
JavaScript is a programming language that enables interactive web features. I am mastering core concepts like variables, loops, functions, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

### 4. Tailwind CSS
Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework that helps build custom designs rapidly. I am learning how to efficiently style web components by using predefined classes.

### 5. React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. I am focused on developing component-based architectures and managing application state in dynamic single-page applications (SPAs).

### 6. Redux
Redux is a state management tool often used with React. I am learning how to manage and share state across components, improving application performance and predictability.

### 7. Data Structures
Understanding data structures like arrays, stacks, queues, and linked lists is critical for writing efficient algorithms. I am learning how to implement and utilize these structures to optimize my code.

### 8. Python
Python is a versatile programming language, and I am exploring its basics. I am learning about syntax, data types, control structures, and functions to build basic scripts and algorithms.

### 9. MySQL Database
MySQL is a relational database management system. I am learning how to design and manage databases using SQL queries for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and complex queries like JOINs and transactions.

### 10. Git Commands
Git is a version control system. I am learning essential commands to collaborate effectively on projects. Below is a complete example workflow that includes all necessary Git commands:

```bash
# 1. Initialize a Repository
git init

# 2. Check Status
git status

# 3. Add Files to Staging
git add <file-name>    # Adds specific file
git add .              # Adds all files in the current directory

# 4. Commit Changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# 5. Push Changes to Remote Repository
git push origin main   # Enter your username and password when prompted

# 6. Create a New Branch
git branch <branch-name>    # Create a new branch
git checkout <branch-name>  # Switch to the new branch

# 7. Pull Updates from Remote
git pull origin main
